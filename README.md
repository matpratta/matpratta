# Matheus "Matt" Pratta

Hey there! My name is Matheus (call me Matt, though, I love it!) and I'm a full-stack developer! I currently work as a software development freelancer with [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/resume/matheus-teruel-pratta#discover-exclusively-shrewd-software-contractors) while also running my own company, [Subatomic](https://subatomic.com.br), where I currently work on my own ideas. I also have previously worked at [Tecnoblog](https://tecnoblog.net) as a full-stack developer, working with technologies such as WordPress and Prebid.

Currently I mostly do back-end work, using both PHP and JavaScript, but I also have some experience working on front-end development, specially with SCSS and Vue.js. As a secondary skill set, I also have some knowledge on design, color theory and image editing, which I mostly use to enhance prototypes and improve development work.
